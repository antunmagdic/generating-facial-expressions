\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we have presented how StarGAN model can be used to generate
various facial expressions. Based on generative adversarial networks, generator
competes with discriminator to achueve the best results. Noticeable differences
are observed between the original set of images and the images generated for 
given emotions (Angry, Happy, Sad, Surprise). Even though the changes are
visible, additional training of the model would improve the quality of results.
