\begin{abstract}
Since 2014 when they were first proposed by Ian Goodfellow, generative
adversarial networks have been successfully used in various image generation
tasks. In this project we use them to generate facial expressions corresponding
to different emotions (Angry, Happy, Sad, Surprise). Developed GAN model takes 
an image of a person’s face and a desired emotion as inputs. It outputs the image
of the same person’s face, but with the required emotion applied. A large part of 
generated images look like real photos of real people. Unfortunately, since GANs
are still under research, a human eye can almost always distinguish real images 
from the fake.
